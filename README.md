# Poker Project

## Why?

I was living in Fort Worth, and missed playing poker with my friends. I wanted a way to play online and thought it would be cool if I made something that could do it.

I modified a fair bit of the hand evaluation from the [Deuces](https://github.com/worldveil/deuces) library. I liked that they were using bitwise evaluation.
